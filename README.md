A show about the internet, how it's built and the people who use it. [hosttheworld.org](http://hosttheworld.org)

Dust off that keyboard - there's work to be done! Every episode Joe completes a project that incorporates a different software tool. His projects are quirky and sometimes laughably bad - but always educational. Join his quest to Host The World!
